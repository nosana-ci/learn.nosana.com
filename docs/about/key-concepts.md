# Key Concepts

## Deployments

Deployments are long-lived objects that describe *what* to run (job definition) and *where/how* to run it (market, strategy, replicas, timeout).

- Learn more in **[Deployments Intro](../deployments/intro.md)**.
- See configuration details in **[Deployment Options](../deployments/options.md)**.

## Job Definition

The job definition is a JSON specification that describes the container image, commands, and runtime requirements for your workload.

- Start with **[Job Definition Intro](../job-definition/intro.md)**.
- Explore schemas and examples in the Job Definition section.

## Markets

Markets represent pools of GPU resources where your deployments are scheduled.

- See **[GPU Markets](../gpu-markets.md)** for available markets.
