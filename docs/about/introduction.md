# Introduction

Welcome to the Nosana Network!

## What is Nosana?

Nosana is a company founded by [Jesse Eisses](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jesse-eisses-9760ab48) and [Sjoerd Dijkstra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjoerd-dijkstra/) in 2021. They imagined a secure, decentralised, and distributed compute network where anyone can contribute their computing hardware, and be automatically, and fairly, paid to run software for others. To that end, Nosana is today at the intersection of cutting-edge technologies such as: a fully decentralized and transparent marketplace of compute resources built on blockchain smart-contracts, a highly distributed network of compute resources built on open-source software, and a tight integration with the underlying GPU hardware to support even the most demanding AI workloads.      

Nosana builds on top of the Solana blockchain and has developed their own Nosana token, that serves as the currency within the Nosana Network. This network connects hardware hosts (be it computers in data centers or privately owned) to people in need of reliable compute resources. Given the sheer amount of high-quality GPUs available on the Nosana Network, and despite this network being workload agnostic, running <Glossary term="AI Inference">AI inferences</Glossary> is easier and cheaper than ever.

## What does Nosana offer?

On top of the decentralized and highly-available network, Nosana also offers software and services that make it easier to both participate in the network as a <Glossary term="Host">host</Glossary> that rents out their compute resources, and build innovative AI powered software solutions. Nosana created, and continuously maintains, an open and decentralized protocol to govern and match supply with demand. In addition to that, Nosana open sources the reference implementation of the software that <Glossary term="Host">hosts</Glossary> run to integrate in the network, and the APIs that support the users of the network in executing their workloads. Users can consume the Nosana APIs directly, using their favourite technologies, or through the Nosana Software Development Kits (SDKs) for a seamless integration. Because it's all open-source, anyone can contribute new SDKs for the Nosana APIs. 

Nosana supports both batch and online workloads. Workloads can be started on-demand or scheduled to run at specific times, and even at specific frequencies. For batch processing workloads, Nosana provides integrations for users to provide input and collect output. While for online workloads, Nosana provides service endpoints (that can be APIs, or websites, or whatever other form of service) that are publicly accessible. Users can easily build security controls and high-availability into their services to whatever degree needed.

## Nosana's Vision

Nosana aims at truly and effectively democratizing access to compute resources (especially GPUs) currently in the hands of massive (big-tech) companies, by leveraging the transparency and decentralization inherent to the blockchain technology. Empowering communities is at the heart of Nosana's vision of the future, but also increasing the utilization of the existing hardware to reduce waste.
